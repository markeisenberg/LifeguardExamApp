    <string name="stroke_text">Inverted breast stroke - The upper part of the leg is kept in line with
        the body. As the knees open slightly the legs are lowered and the feet are "cocked". The legs
        are then swept sideways and together in a swirling or circular movement with the insides
        of the lower legs pressing against the resistance of the water.</string>
    <string name="reverse_text">The ability to reverse from the prone swimming position, 
        in order to move quickly out of a subject\'s reach or to assume a "ready" position prior
        to affecting a rescue is essential to the safety of the rescuer.</string>
    <string name="fronta_text">The threatened swimmer tries to avoid the subject\'s grasp by 
        tucking in his chin. At the same time he pushes his attacker with both hands at hip,
        waist, shoulders or chest. A vigorous extension of the arms upwards forces the subject
        to the surface, as the swimmer submerges to make his escape underwater. All actions
        should be carried out speedily and aggressively.</string>
    <string name="frontb_text">When grasped around the head and neck from the front the rescuer should
        immediately take a quick breath, tuck in his chin, and submerge himself and the subject.
        By pushing vigorously upwards with his hands on the subject\'s hips, ribs or armpits
        he should loosen the grasp sufficiently to duck free. Speed is essential to prevent the
        subject locking his legs around the rescuer.</string>
    <string name="frontc_text">An alternative technique is for the rescuer to reach over the subject\'s 
        arm, place their hand on opposite side of subject\'s face, place thumb and heel of hand
        place under jawbone and their hand spread across the victim\'s face, little finger
        pressed against the side of the nose. The rescuer takes a grip with his other hand
        on the subject\'s arm, just above the elbow. By pushing upwards on the arm and away on the
        face the rescuer can break the grip and turn the subject. The grip on the arm is held while
        the other hand is withdrawn from the face and used to effect the "level".</string>
    <string name="frontd_text">The rescuer is gripped around the arms and body. He should in turn
        grasp the subject on both sides of the body at any position he can reach. The armpits or
        base of the ribs are preferred positions. Tucking in his chin and thrusting his elbows
        away from his side the rescuer forcefully pushes the subject away and upwards. The rescuer
        is forced below the surface and can back away under water.</string>
    <string name="level_text">For an effective and speedy rescue, the rescuer must be able to level the 
        subject into the horizontal position on the back. This position may be achieved quickly as the 
        carry or tow gets under way. In the case of a heavy subject it may be necessary for the 
        rescuer to assist in the levelling by using a hand placed in the centre of the back.
        The level is then maintained by the speed of the carry and by the support of the rescuer\'s
        lower body underneath the subject. The subject\'s head is levered firmly backwards while the 
        rescuer strokes vigorously with legs and free arm.</string>
    <string name="chest_text">Chest carry - The subject\'s shoulder should fit snugly into the
        rescuer\'s armpit with his head on the rescuer\'s shoulder. When changing from level to
        cross-chest carry the rescuer brings the swimming arm over the shoulder of the subject,
        securing a grip towars the far armpit with the forearm across the chest and the elbow
        held firmly down.</string>
    <string name="head_text">Head carry - From the levelling position, the rescuer takes a firm hold
        of the subject\'s head (palms of the hands on the ears, fingers extended along the jaws
        and thumbs on the temples) and tows to safety. The arm are held straight with the wrists
        depressed, except when it is necessary to raise the subject\'s head, where they are bent to form
        a right angle at the elbows.</string>
    <string name="hair_text">Hair carry - From the "level" position, the rescuer brings the stroking
        hand to the back of the subject\'s head, with fingers partially spread, and slides them forward
        to grasp the hair. The wrist is depressed and with the arm straight, the rescuer tows the
        subject to safety, checking constantly that the subject\'s face is above water. Either arm
        can be used to "level". The other arm us used to carry while always maintaining contact during
        change over.</string>
    <string name="backgrab_text">As soon as the rescuer feels the arms encircling his head he should
        do two things automatically i.e. tuck his chin and get a good breath of air. He should
        then submerge with the subject. This may force the subject to release his grip. However, if it
        is necessary to break the grasp, the rescuer should seize the wrist of the subject\'s
        lower arm with his opposite hand and with the other hand get a forking grip just above the
        elbow of the same arm, thumb on the inside. By twisting the subject\'s hand outwards and 
        pushing up the elbow with the other hand he can then duck under the elbow that he had forced
        up to position himself behind the subject. The grip on the wrist should be held until the other
        hand is moved from the elbow to the chin to take a "level".</string>
    <string name="backrelease_text">An alternative technique is for the rescuer to bring his hands
        to the underside of the victim\'s arms just above the elbows. Keeping the chin tucked in
        and the shoulders lifted the rescuer pushes upwards forcefully. While twisting the head and
        shoulders he pushes the subject back and away. As the subject releases the grip the rescuer swims
        up and out of reach.</string>
    <string name="splinta_text">Where the victim is facedown, a head clamp technique can be used to
        immobilize the head and neck while rotating the victim into a face-up position on the
        surface of the water.</string>
    <string name="splintb_text">From a position alongside the victim, the rescuer grasps each arm between
        shoulder and elbow and gently extends the arms forward on each side of the victim\'s head.</string>  
    <string name="splintc_text">With arms pressed firmly alongside the victim\'s head, a splint or clamp
        is provided to immobalize the head and neck.</string>
    <string name="splintd_text">A slow headfirst directed glide will move the victim towards a horizontal
        position from which the body can more easily be rotated into a face-up position. The body is now rotated
        by pressing the victim\'s nearest arm underneath the water while, at the same time drawing
        the other arm across the surface until the body rests on the crook of the rescuer\'s arm.</string>
    <string name="splinte_text">Immobilisation is maintained in that position while the rescuer
        checks breathing. Rescue breathing may be applied, if necessary, by using the chest and one arm
        to maintain the head clamp. N.B. This technique to immobilize the head and neck can be used in 
        deep or shallow water.</string>
    <string name="clampa_text">Move close to the victim\'s side, at shoulder depth, so that the
        victim\'s body is against your chest. You may have to move the arm nearest to you so that
        the victim\'s shoulder and arm are in position against your chest. Place one forearm
        along the sternum with the fingers grasping the victim\'s chin (thumb to one side of the chin,
        fingers to the other side) and the other forearm along the victim\'s spine with the hand
        supporting the base of the skull.</string>
    <string name="clampb_text">Squeeze both forearms together to create a vice, which clamps the 
        victim\'s chest and back. The hand and fingers are tightened to restrict movement of the head
        to secure immobilisation. Glide the victim forward to a horiztonal position and commence
        rescue breathing, if necessary.</string>
    <string name="clampc_text">N.B. If the victim is face-down, the body must be rotated to a face-up
        position. Using the same rescue method, gently slide under the victim, rotating the body to
        a face-up position as you surface at the other side of the victim, while retaining your hands
         and forearms clamp grip.</string>
