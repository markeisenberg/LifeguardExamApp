# LifeguardExamApp
This is the GitHub repository for my B.Sc. Digital Media Design Final Year Project - An Android application designed to be used for the Pool Lifeguard Examinations

I've uploaded this repo on to GitHub so I can show my work in a new age way :) I finished this project in April 2015.
